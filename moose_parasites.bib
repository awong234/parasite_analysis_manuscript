abstract = {After nearly a century of decline and range contraction in the northeastern United States, moose (Alces alces) have re-colonized Adirondack Park, New York due to improved habitat and adjacent source populations. In this paper I present the results of 2 Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) models used to examine the pattern of moose recovery in Adirondack Park. Sighting data collected in 1980-1999 by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation were used to compare moose locations with 3 suitability levels of moose habitat predicted by the HSI models. The 2 models indicated that most of Adirondack Park was a combination of suitable (49-73{\%}) and most suitable habitat (10-35{\%}) for moose; the majority (53-77{\%}) of sightings occurred in suitable habitat. However, the distribution of moose locations derived from sighting data might have been influenced by where human recreational activity occurred because sighting locations were not well correlated with the most suitable habitat. The combined analysis of the sighting locations and the HSI models provided valuable insight into the current and potential occupation and distribution of moose in Adirondack Park.},

@article{Lenarz2009,
abstract = {It is well established that white-tailed deer are the normal host for P. tenuis and that this parasite either kills moose directly or predisposes them to other causes of mortality. Despite the historical record of moose dying from this parasite, there is little evidence, that P. tenuis is a major cause of mortality in moose or that it was responsible for historic declines in moose populations. When white-tailed deer expanded their range northward into moose range following logging, they undoubtedly introduced P. tenuis to moose. While it may seem intuitive that higher deer numbers should translate into higher moose mortality, research has not corroborated this relationship. Rather, it has discovered that the transmission of P. tenuis between deer and moose is a complex relationship and after almost 45 years, this relationship is still poorly understood. Based on our current knowledge, reductions in deer density on moose range will likely have little effect on the population status of moose in Minnesota.},

@article{Lankester2010,
abstract = {Periodic declines in moose (Alces alces) populations have occurred repeatedly during the past century on the southern fringe of moose range in central and eastern North America. These slow declines, occurring over a number of years, are associated with higher than usual numbers of co-habiting white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Numerous proximate causes have been hy­pothesized but none has gained widespread acceptance among cervid managers. However, current knowledge of the nature of moose declines and the biology of meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) makes this parasite the most credible explanation. Other suggested disease-related causes are rejected, including infection with liver flukes (Fascioloides magna) because there is no clinical evi­dence that flukes kill moose. As well, this parasite occurs at only moderate prevalence and intensity in some jurisdictions and is completely absent in others where moose declines are known. Winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus), on the other hand, do kill moose but usually have a distinctly different and more immediate impact on populations. It is recognized that moose, albeit at lower density, can persist for extended periods in the presence of P. tenuis-infected deer at moderate densities. However, it is argued here that parelaphostrongylosis can, when conditions favour sustained high deer densities and enhanced gastropod transmission, cause moose numbers to decline to low numbers or to become locally extinct. Short, mild winters favour deer population growth in areas previously best suited for moose. Wetter and longer snow-free periods increase the numbers and availability of terrestrial gastro­pod intermediate hosts and the period for parasite transmission. It is hypothesized that these climatic conditions increase rates of meningeal worm transmission to moose and of disease, primarily among younger cohorts. Reports of overtly sick moose are common during declines but may not account for the total mortality and morbidity caused by meningeal worm. Means by which the parasite may lower recruitment and productivity causing slow declines still needs clarification. Managers in areas prone to declines should monitor weather trends, deer numbers, and the prevalence of meningeal worm in deer. Moose recovery will occur only after deer numbers are decidedly reduced, either by appropriate management or a series of severe winters.},

@article{Kuzyk2018,
abstract = {Licenced harvest of moose (Alces alces) in British Columbia, Canada declined by approximately half over the 20-year period from 1996-2015. To better understand changes in moose populations coinciding with this period of declining harvest, we modelled population dynamics within 31 Game Management Zones (GMZs). We used aerial survey data (180 density and 159 composition surveys) combined with licensed harvest to develop 4 competing statistical models to assess population dynamics based on constant parameters and temporal trends in calf:cow ratios at 6 months, juvenile survival from 6-18 months, or cow survival. The models indicated that moose populations declined ($\lambda$ {\textless} 1) in 7 GMZs (23{\%}) from 1996-2005 and in 22 GMZs (71{\%}) from 2006-2015. Over the 20-year period, the best model was fit with declining trends in calf:cow ratios in 8 GMZs, declining juvenile survival in 6 GMZs, and declining cow survival in 8 GMZs. Population growth rate was slightly reduced in those GMZs where licenced antlerless (cow and calf) hunting occurred but was not considered the primary factor causing population decline. Total licenced bull harvest influenced bull:cow ratios that were significantly lower in 2006-2015 (x = 37:100) than 1995-2005 (x = 48:100); significant predictive relationships existed between harvest rates and bull:cow ratios. Provincial moose numbers and harvest were highly correlated (r = 0.81) suggesting that declining harvest was a reaction to declining population trends. We found that the provincial moose population increased 6{\%} from 1996-2005, subsequently declined 32{\%} from 2006-2015, and declined 29{\%} overall during the 20-year study period.},
