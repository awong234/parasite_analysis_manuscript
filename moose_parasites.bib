@article{Hickey2008,
abstract = {After nearly a century of decline and range contraction in the northeastern United States, moose (Alces alces) have re-colonized Adirondack Park, New York due to improved habitat and adjacent source populations. In this paper I present the results of 2 Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) models used to examine the pattern of moose recovery in Adirondack Park. Sighting data collected in 1980-1999 by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation were used to compare moose locations with 3 suitability levels of moose habitat predicted by the HSI models. The 2 models indicated that most of Adirondack Park was a combination of suitable (49-73{\%}) and most suitable habitat (10-35{\%}) for moose; the majority (53-77{\%}) of sightings occurred in suitable habitat. However, the distribution of moose locations derived from sighting data might have been influenced by where human recreational activity occurred because sighting locations were not well correlated with the most suitable habitat. The combined analysis of the sighting locations and the HSI models provided valuable insight into the current and potential occupation and distribution of moose in Adirondack Park.},

@article{Lenarz2009,
abstract = {It is well established that white-tailed deer are the normal host for P. tenuis and that this parasite either kills moose directly or predisposes them to other causes of mortality. Despite the historical record of moose dying from this parasite, there is little evidence, that P. tenuis is a major cause of mortality in moose or that it was responsible for historic declines in moose populations. When white-tailed deer expanded their range northward into moose range following logging, they undoubtedly introduced P. tenuis to moose. While it may seem intuitive that higher deer numbers should translate into higher moose mortality, research has not corroborated this relationship. Rather, it has discovered that the transmission of P. tenuis between deer and moose is a complex relationship and after almost 45 years, this relationship is still poorly understood. Based on our current knowledge, reductions in deer density on moose range will likely have little effect on the population status of moose in Minnesota.},
