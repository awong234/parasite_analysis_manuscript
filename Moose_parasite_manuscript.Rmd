# Introduction

Moose (*Alces alces*) populations are in decline in parts of their range in
North America such as in Minnesota, Vermont, and New Hampshire in the United
States of America and Nova Scotia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario
in Canada [@Lankester2018; @Timmermann2017]. Some researchers point to parasite
infection from liver fluke (*Fascioloides magna*) and/or brainworm
(*Parelaphastrongylus tenuis*) as contributing factors to these declines
[@Murray2006; @Lankester2010; @Lankester2018; @Wunschmann2015], although this
claim is controversial [@Lenarz2009] and in some areas may coincide with other
factors such as depredation or low reproduction rates that may disguise effects
of parasite infection [@SHANNONBARBERMEYER2016; @Kuzyk2018]. Nevertheless, brain
worm and liver fluke cause morbidity and mortality in moose populations and
should be monitored.

In the Adirondacks of New York, moose populations have increased since their
extirpation in the late 19th century, but their populations have not seen the
same growth during the 20th century as their New England counterparts
[@Timmermann2017]. Recent estimates of moose population size indicate that there
are approximately 600 to 1000 moose in the Adirondacks [@Wong2019], a range
which does not indicate substantial change from previous assertions of
population size [@Hickey2008]. Factors that may be limiting the population are
not established, but the focal parasites *P. tenuis* and *F. magna* have been observed
in moose necropsies with moderate frequency (REF Schuler and/or DEC).

Brain worm and liver fluke are endoparasites that infect white-tailed deer
(*Odocoileus virginianus*) and moose. Infections by *P. tenuis* are benign to
white-tailed deer, but cause severe neurological disorders in moose that often
end in death [@Pybus2001; @Lankester2010].

# Materials and Methods

## Study area

We surveyed within the Adirondack Park of the state of New York. It is an area
of approximately 24,000 $\text{km}^2$, composing approximately 17% of the state
of New York. Elevation ranges from 100m - 1600m. The Adirondack Park contains
primarily upland forest habitat dominated by such species as American beech
(*Fagus grandifolia*), red spruce (*Picea rubens*), hemlock (*Tsuga
canadensis*), sugar maple (*Acer saccharum*), striped maple (*Acer
pensylvanicum*), and balsam fir (*Abies balsamea*). Approximately 20% of the
park is composed of wetland habitats including open river corridors, floating
bogs, and large open bogs dominated by conifers [@Hickey2008].

## Field data collection

White-tailed deer fecal pellet groups were collected opportunistically during
the years of 2016 and 2017 for the purpose of parasite quantification during a
larger survey investigating the population size of moose in the park. The moose
study surveyed triangular transects approximately 3 km long, selected by cluster
random sampling. The clustering design of the transects were optimized for a
spatial capture-recapture survey, including 3 transects per cluster separated by
approximately 2-4 km. **INSERT FIGURE FOR MOOSE TRANSECTS**

In 2018, a single-observer distance sampling protocol was implemented to
quantify deer fecal group abundance in addition to measuring parasite intensity.
Along each moose transects, 6 distance sampling transects each 100m long were
spaced 200m apart from each other. **INSERT FIGURE FOR DEER TRANSECTS** A total
of **N** transects were sampled in 2018. At the specified start point, field
technicians extended a 100m tape to serve as the center line, and made
observations along its length. Any number of scat pellets were considered to
constitute a fecal group, and the approximate number was recorded. When a fecal
group was detected, its distance perpendicular from the center line, and
parallel along the center line was recorded. The perpendicular distance is the
focal variable of distance sampling, but the parallel distance provided highly
precise location coordinates of the scats -- because the start point of the
transect was recorded with greater accuracy (due to longer GPS averaging time),
the coordinates of the scats could be refined by translating the start point in
space by the angle of the transect, and the parallel distance away from the
start point.

Fifty-seven white-tailed deer fecal samples were collected in 2016, 391 samples
were collected in 2017, and 174 samples were collected in 2018.

## Parasitological analyses

The fecal samples were analyzed by the Cornell Animal Health and Diagnostic
Center using several methods. For *F. magna*, Flukefinder, a modified Baermann
technique, and fecal quantitative flotation were used. For *P. tenuis*, the
modified Baermann, and fecal quantitative flotation methods were implemented.
After 2016, the performant method for *F. magna* was determined to be
Flukefinder, and for *P. tenuis* the performant method was the modified Baermann
technique. This was assessed by **HOW? ASK KRYSTEN**, and validated post-hoc to
have the greatest detection probability by an occupancy analysis.

## Statistical Model

For analysis of relative risk of infection to moose, we implemented a
hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework analyzed with the `R` packages `INLA`,
which uses integrated nested Laplace approximation to approximate the posterior
distribution of model parameters, and `inlabru` which extends `INLA` by
integrating thinning of a point process -- in this context, the fecal groups are
modeled as a point process thinned by imperfect detection which is modeled by
distance sampling. Our measure of relative risk of infection to moose is
predicted parasite abundance spatially referenced by the following model.

$$
\widehat{\Lambda}(s) = \hat{\lambda}(s) * \hat{\delta}(s)
$$

where, $\widehat{\Lambda}(s)$ is the estimated parasite abundance at spatial
unit $s$, which is the product of the per-fecal-group-sample abundance
$\hat{\lambda}(s)$ (or, intensity in the epidemiological sense), and the
estimated fecal group abundance $\hat{\delta}(s)$.

### Parasite intensity model

Let $S = \{s_i, i = 1, ..., n\} \subset \Omega$ be the $n$ distinct locations
where white-tailed deer fecal groups were observed within the observation region
$\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, and let $y_i$ be the observed parasite count
within the fecal sample.

Parasites observed within each scat sample are $\ge 0$, and due to the high
prevalence of 0's, we considered a negative binomial distribution in addition to
the Poisson. On any bounded region $B \subseteq \Omega$, observations are thus
modeled as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_i) \\
\log(\mu_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1*x_1(s_i) + ... + \beta_p*x_p(s_i) + \Psi_1(s_i) \\
\Psi_1(s_i) \sim GP(0, \Sigma)
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

Where, $y_i$ represent the parasites observed per fecal group sample, $\mu_i$ is
the mean function modeled dependent upon spatial covariates $x_j(s)$, and
$\Psi_1(s)$ is a random Gaussian process with mean 0 and covariance matrix
$\Sigma$. The covariance function used is the Matern:

\[
\text{cov}[\Psi(s), \Psi(s')] = \sigma_{\Psi}^2 \  \kappa ||s' - s|| \ \mathcal{K}_1(\kappa ||s' - s||)
\]

where $\tau, \kappa$ are variance and range scaling parameters, respectively,
$\sigma_{\Psi}^2 = 1/(4\pi\kappa^2\tau^2)$ is the marginal variance, and
$\mathcal{K}_1$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind and order 1
(See @Lindgren2015 for the specific representation and estimation of the spatial
random effects within INLA). The spatial random field is optional and we test
models with and without it to assess support for modeling unstructured spatial
dependence.

#### Priors 

#### Covariates on parasite intensity

In our model, we consider the following covariate effects on parasite intensity.
Coordinate data (UTM Easting and Northing) are included to model broad-scale
spatial trend. We considered a derived variable of precipitation representing
the total accumulation of precipitation in the year prior to the data collection
date, measured in inches. Precipitation affects the survival of *P. tenuis* and
*F. magna* outside of a host (i.e. as L1 larvae, and eggs in feces,
respectively), and so it is anticipated that deer would be more likely to be
infected in areas of higher rainfall [@Pybus2001]. Additionally, gastropod
activity is inhibited by drought, and so higher rainfall would suggest higher
risk of infection due to a higher availability of gastropods to be ingested in
the case of *P. tenuis* [@Lankester2018]. We used the spatially interpolated
PRISM dataset for precipitation [@PRISM]. We considered another derived variable
for snowfall accumulation in the snowfall season prior to the data collection
date (that is, from September until April prior to the date of survey). Similar
to precipitation, we anticipate that areas that experience low snowfall prior to
the survey date will exhibit a higher parasite intensity due to increased
parasite survival, and increased activity of gastropod intermediate hosts. The
National Weather Service's National Snowfall Analysis dataset was used to obtain
spatially-referenced snowfall amounts.

Local terrain basins where water may collect were considered as a potentially
important effect particularly for *F. magna*, as the life cycle of the parasite
has a period during which metacercariae encyst on aquatic vegetation and once
matured infect aquatic snail intermediate hosts. We hypothesized that intensity
of infection for *F. magna* will be greater in basins than on slopes or peaks,
and we assessed this by the geomorphon tool in QGIS, assessed at a resolution of
40km (1600 squared-kilometers). This resolution was selected because it
maximized the variation in the geomorphon value types relative to our sample
locations.

### Distance sampling model

The white tailed deer fecal groups are treated as an log Gaussian Cox point
process which are thinned by imperfect observation, and the rate of detection is
a parameter to be estimated. Within any bounded region $B \subseteq \Omega$, let
$\Lambda(s)$ be the mean intensity function under the following distribution:

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
N(B) \sim \text{Poisson}(\Lambda(s)*|B|) \\
\log\Lambda(s) = \beta_{p+1}*x_{p+1}(s) + ... + \beta_{m}*x_{m}(s) + \Psi_2(s) \\
\Psi_2(s) \sim GP(0, \Sigma)
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

where, $N(B)$ is the realization of the total abundance of fecal groups within
$B$, $x_j(s) \in {x_{p+1}(s), ..., x_{m}(s)}$ are spatial covariates that may be
the same as those used in the parasite intensity model, $\Psi_2(s)$ is a
Gaussian process distinct to $\Psi_1(s)$.

#### Covariates on deer fecal group intensity

Deer fecal group abundance is assumed to be proportional to deer density, and so
factors affecting deer density should correlate with deer fecal group abundance.
We do not attempt to quantify deer density *per se* because the density of
infected fecal groups within an area more directly influences the probability
that intermediate gastropod hosts will become infected, and thus risk of
infection to moose.

We modeled deer fecal group abundance to be dependent upon habitat, road
density, elevation, and a local spatial random effect. 

Habitat was obtained from The Nature Conservancy's Terrestrial Habitat Map
[@Feree2013] and reclassified into major categories of deciduous, coniferous,
and mixed forest, wetland, and 'other' (see Appendix for reclass mapping).

Road density was derived from the 2017 TIGER line dataset [@TIGER2017] as the
kernel density of roads separated into "major roads" (highways, interstates,
county roads), and "minor roads" (local streets, residence drives, etc.). This
was evaluated using the ArcMap tool "Kernel Density Estimate" under default
settings.

Elevation was obtained from the National Elevation Dataset [@NED2017].

We assumed homogeneous detection probability over all of our surveys in our
modeling.
